  "description": "This dataset contains counts and rates (per 10,000 residents) of asthma emergency department (ED) visits among Californians. The table “Asthma Emergency Department Visit Rates by County” contains statewide and county-level data stratified by age group (all ages, 0-17, 18+, 0-4, 5-17, 18-64, 65+) and race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native). The table “Asthma Emergency Department Visit Rates by ZIP Code” contains zip-code level data stratified by age group (all ages, 0-17, 18+). The data are derived from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development emergency department database. These data include emergency department visits from all licensed hospitals in California. These data are based only on primary discharge diagnosis codes. On October 1, 2015, diagnostic coding for asthma transitioned from ICD9-CM (493) to ICD10-CM (J45). Because of this change, CDPH and CDC do not recommend comparing data from 2015 (or earlier) to 2016 (or later).  NOTE: Rates are calculated from the total number of asthma emergency department visits (not the unique number of individuals).\r\n\r\n",
